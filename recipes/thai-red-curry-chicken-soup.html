    <p>Red curry chicken is a family favorite so I adapted it into a soup. That way you never miss any of the delicious sauce!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons red curry paste</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk</li>

        <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook curry paste in a large, heavy saucepan over medium-high heat until oils start to release, 1 to 2 minutes. Add red pepper and onion and cook, stirring, until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in coconut milk until well blended. Add fish sauce, and then chicken stock.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes. Add cooked chicken and rice. Stir over heat until warmed through. Add chopped cilantro right before serving.</li>
